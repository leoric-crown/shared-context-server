# Execute Product Requirement Prompt (PRP)

Implement features using intelligent coordination that respects project architecture and provides consistent, high-quality outcomes.

## PRP File: $ARGUMENTS (from PRPs/2-prps/)

## ðŸŽ¯ Intelligent Coordination Approach

**Core Principle**: Default to coordination-aware implementation that respects architectural integration, component coordination, and context preservation. Let content and context drive agent selection, not user routing decisions.

### Automatic Workflow Detection

The framework intelligently analyzes your PRP content and context to provide appropriate coordination:

- **File Pattern Analysis**: Detects which components are affected (services, data handling, UI, integration)
- **Content Scope Analysis**: Understands feature complexity, architectural impact, and integration requirements
- **Context Awareness**: Considers existing project state, active work, and component coordination needs
- **Quality Requirements**: Automatically applies appropriate testing, documentation, and validation

### Architecture-Centric Integration by Default

All work assumes and preserves the project's foundational architecture:
- **UTC Timestamps**: Consistent time coordination across all MCP operations
- **FastMCP Integration**: MCP tool and resource coordination with async patterns
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Shared context sessions and agent memory isolation
- **Database Operations**: aiosqlite with connection pooling for concurrent agent access
- **Memory Architecture**: Three-tier memory system (public context, private notes, agent memory)

## ðŸ¤– Intelligent Agent Coordination

Based on content analysis and architectural requirements, agents are automatically selected:

### Core Coordination Team
- **developer**: Research-first FastMCP implementation with async/await patterns
- **tester**: Behavioral testing with FastMCP TestClient and multi-agent scenarios
- **refactor**: Safety-first improvements when file size or complexity triggers
- **docs**: User-focused MCP server documentation and API examples
- **task-coordinator**: Multi-phase orchestration for complex MCP server features

### Smart Agent Selection Logic
```
Content Analysis Results â†’ Agent Selection:

â€¢ FastMCP implementation needed â†’ developer (always)
â€¢ MCP tool/resource changes â†’ tester (behavioral + multi-agent testing)
â€¢ Files >500 lines â†’ refactor (automatic safety trigger)
â€¢ New MCP server features â†’ docs (API documentation + examples)
â€¢ Database schema changes â†’ task-coordinator (multi-phase orchestration)
â€¢ Multi-agent coordination â†’ specialized testing and validation
â€¢ External service integration â†’ enhanced fallback and error handling
```

## ðŸ“‹ Standard Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning (5-10 min)
1. **Content Analysis**: Automatically detect scope, complexity, and integration requirements
2. **Agent Selection**: Choose appropriate agent coordination based on detected needs
3. **Research Context**: Leverage any pre-provided research or initiate MCP research as needed
4. **Architecture Validation**: Ensure architectural approach and integration awareness

### Phase 2: Implementation Coordination (Variable Duration)
1. **Context-Rich Agent Handoffs**: Provide comprehensive context to selected agents
2. **Quality Gate Monitoring**: Ensure standards are maintained throughout implementation
3. **Integration Verification**: Validate that changes work within existing architecture
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor implementation progress and coordinate between agents when needed

### Phase 3: Quality Validation & Completion (10-15 min)
1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Behavioral testing with integration point validation
2. **Architecture Integration**: Ensure all components work together properly
3. **Documentation Review**: Verify user-facing changes are properly documented
4. **Final Quality Check**: Linting, type checking, and architectural compliance

## ðŸ”§ Context-Aware Coordination Features

### Research Context Integration
- **Pre-Research Utilization**: Use research context from PRP generation to avoid duplicate work
- **Targeted MCP Research**: Additional research only when specific implementation details are needed
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain research findings throughout implementation coordination

### Architectural Awareness
- **Integration Point Detection**: Automatically identify required integration work
- **Component Coordination**: Ensure multi-component features work together seamlessly
- **State Management**: Preserve and coordinate application state appropriately
- **Service Dependencies**: Handle external service coordination and fallback scenarios

### Quality Integration
- **Behavioral Testing Focus**: Test MCP tools and resources behavior, not implementation
- **Multi-Agent Testing**: Verify concurrent agent access and session isolation
- **FastMCP TestClient**: In-memory testing patterns for rapid feedback
- **API Documentation**: User-focused MCP server documentation and examples

## ðŸš€ Advanced Coordination Scenarios

### Complex MCP Server Features
For multi-agent coordination features affecting 4+ files or requiring >8 hours of work:
1. **task-coordinator** orchestrates multi-phase MCP implementation
2. **Phased approach**: Plan â†’ Implement â†’ Test Multi-Agent â†’ Validate
3. **Quality gates**: Checkpoints at each phase with user approval
4. **Context preservation**: Maintain MCP server architecture and agent coordination patterns

### Database Schema Modifications
For changes affecting core MCP server architecture or multi-agent patterns:
1. **Architecture-first analysis**: Understand impact on multi-agent coordination
2. **Incremental approach**: Small, safe database migrations with validation
3. **Multi-agent testing**: Comprehensive testing of concurrent access patterns
4. **Rollback planning**: Clear rollback strategy for database schema changes

### Agent Memory Integration Work
For agent memory systems or external service coordination:
1. **Memory pattern analysis**: Use established three-tier memory architecture
2. **Fallback strategy**: Implement memory fallback and TTL expiration handling
3. **Context isolation**: Ensure proper agent memory isolation and sharing
4. **Behavioral testing**: FastMCP TestClient testing for memory operations
