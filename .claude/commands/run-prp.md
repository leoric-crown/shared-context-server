# Execute Product Requirement Prompt (PRP)

## Description

**PRP Lifecycle Stage: 3-completed (Implementation & Completion)**

Implement features using intelligent coordination that respects project architecture and provides consistent, high-quality outcomes.

**Lifecycle Position**: Executes PRPs from `PRPs/2-prps/` through to completion
**Input**: Implementation specifications from `PRPs/2-prps/`
**Output**: Completed features with archival to `PRPs/3-completed/`
**Completion**: Feature is production-ready with full quality validation

## Workflow

### ðŸŽ¯ Intelligent Coordination Approach

**Core Principle**: Default to coordination-aware implementation that respects architectural integration, component coordination, and context preservation. Let content and context drive agent selection, not user routing decisions.

### Automatic Workflow Detection

The framework intelligently analyzes your PRP content and context to provide appropriate coordination:

- **File Pattern Analysis**: Detects which components are affected (services, data handling, UI, integration)
- **Content Scope Analysis**: Understands feature complexity, architectural impact, and integration requirements
- **Context Awareness**: Considers existing project state, active work, and component coordination needs
- **Quality Requirements**: Automatically applies appropriate testing, documentation, and validation

### Architecture-Centric Integration by Default

All work assumes and preserves the multi-agent framework's foundational architecture:

- **UTC Timestamps**: Consistent time coordination across all operations
- **Component Integration**: Multi-component coordination and state preservation
- **Data Preservation**: Established data handling patterns with change tracking
- **Service Context Sharing**: Context preservation and coordination patterns
- **State Management**: Interface and component consistency

## ðŸ¤– Intelligent Agent Coordination

Based on content analysis and architectural requirements, agents are automatically selected:

### Core Coordination Team

- **developer**: Research-first implementation with architectural awareness
- **tester**: Behavioral testing with integration validation
- **refactor**: Safety-first improvements when file size or complexity triggers
- **docs**: User-focused documentation when new features or APIs created
- **task-coordinator**: Multi-phase orchestration for complex architectural changes

### Smart Agent Selection Logic

```
Content Analysis Results â†’ Agent Selection:

â€¢ Code implementation needed â†’ developer (always)
â€¢ UI changes detected â†’ tester (behavioral + visual regression)
â€¢ Files >500 lines â†’ refactor (automatic safety trigger)
â€¢ New user-facing features â†’ docs (consideration prompt)
â€¢ Architecture changes â†’ task-coordinator (multi-phase orchestration)
â€¢ Service integration work â†’ specialized integration validation
â€¢ Component coordination â†’ enhanced coordination checks
```

## ðŸ“‹ Standard Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Session Setup & Analysis & Planning

1. **Create Implementation Session**: Create a shared-context session for this implementation stage:
   - Purpose: "Implementation: [feature name from PRP]"
   - Metadata: Include project name, implementation date, and PRP source reference
   - Use session to store all implementation progress, coordination decisions, and outcomes
2. **Content Analysis**: Automatically detect scope, complexity, and integration requirements
3. **Agent Selection**: Choose appropriate agent coordination based on detected needs
4. **Research Context**: Leverage any pre-provided research or initiate MCP research as needed
5. **Architecture Validation**: Ensure architectural approach and integration awareness
6. **Store Analysis Results**: Add PRP analysis and coordination strategy to implementation session

### Phase 2: Implementation Coordination (Variable Duration)

1. **Context-Rich Agent Handoffs**: Provide comprehensive context to selected agents
2. **Quality Gate Monitoring**: Ensure standards are maintained throughout implementation
3. **Integration Verification**: Validate that changes work within existing architecture
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor implementation progress and coordinate between agents when needed
5. **Store Implementation Progress**: Add ongoing progress, decisions, and coordination outcomes to session:
   - Agent coordination decisions and handoffs
   - Implementation milestones and progress updates
   - Quality gate results and validation outcomes
   - Integration testing results and architectural compliance

### Phase 3: Quality Validation & Completion

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Behavioral testing with integration point validation
2. **Architecture Integration**: Ensure all components work together properly
3. **Documentation Review**: Verify user-facing changes are properly documented
4. **Final Quality Check**: Linting, type checking, and architectural compliance
5. **Store Completion Results**: Add final validation outcomes and completion status to session:
   - Final testing results and quality gate status
   - Architecture integration validation
   - Documentation completion and user experience validation
   - Production readiness assessment

## ðŸ”§ Context-Aware Coordination Features

### Research Context Integration

- **Pre-Research Utilization**: Use research context from PRP generation to avoid duplicate work
- **Targeted MCP Research**: Additional research only when specific implementation details are needed
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain research findings throughout implementation coordination

### Architectural Awareness

- **Integration Point Detection**: Automatically identify required integration work
- **Component Coordination**: Ensure multi-component features work together seamlessly
- **State Management**: Preserve and coordinate application state appropriately
- **Service Dependencies**: Handle external service coordination and fallback scenarios

### Quality Integration

- **Behavioral Testing Focus**: Test what the software does, not how it's implemented
- **Integration Testing**: Verify components work together correctly
- **Visual Validation**: Screenshot capture for UI changes (when tooling is available)
- **Documentation Generation**: User-focused documentation for public features

## ðŸš€ Advanced Coordination Scenarios

### Complex Feature Implementation

For multi-component features affecting 4+ files or requiring >8 hours of work:

1. **task-coordinator** orchestrates multi-phase implementation
2. **Phased approach**: Plan â†’ Implement â†’ Integrate â†’ Validate
3. **Quality gates**: Checkpoints at each phase with user approval
4. **Context preservation**: Maintain architectural context across phases

### Architectural Modifications

For changes affecting core architecture or integration patterns:

1. **Architecture-first analysis**: Understand impact before implementation
2. **Incremental approach**: Small, safe changes with validation at each step
3. **Integration testing**: Comprehensive testing of integration points
4. **Rollback planning**: Clear rollback strategy if integration issues arise

### Service Integration Work

For external service integration or provider coordination:

1. **Provider pattern analysis**: Use established service integration patterns
2. **Fallback strategy**: Implement provider fallback and error handling
3. **Context sharing**: Ensure service context is preserved appropriately
4. **Integration testing**: Mock-based testing for external service behavior
