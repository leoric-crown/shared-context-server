## ⚠️ Issues Identified

### **MINOR ISSUES (1)**

#### **Threading Parameter Validation Issue** ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Component**: Message threading functionality (`parent_message_id` parameter)
- **Status**: **FIXED** - Threading now works through MCP interface
- **Solution Applied**:
  - Removed `gt=0` constraint from `models_core.py` to match `session_tools.py`
  - Applied Gemini CLI compatibility pattern using `Any` type with `json_schema_extra`
  - Updated schema to `{"type": ["integer", "null"]}` for proper MCP validation
- **Verification**:
  - ✅ MCP interface threading test: Messages 565→567→568 thread structure confirmed
  - ✅ Unit tests: All 3 threading tests pass
  - ✅ No regressions: Session and message storage tests all pass
- **Fix Time**: 30 minutes

### **CRITICAL ISSUES: NONE** 🎉

### **MAJOR ISSUES: NONE** 🎉
