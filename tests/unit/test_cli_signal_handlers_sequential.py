"""
Tests for CLI signal handlers that require sequential execution.

This file contains tests that conflict with pytest-xdist parallel execution
due to signal handler installation and I/O capture interactions at the
infrastructure level (contextlib.py:137).

# Note: TestExtremeCLIEdgeCases, TestProductionServerErrorPaths, and
# TestMainConfigurationPaths tests all cause fundamental pytest I/O capture
# conflicts at the contextlib.py:137 level, even with sequential execution.
# These extreme edge cases involve:
# - Deep CLI module import manipulation
# - Signal handler installation conflicts
# - Complex asyncio and subprocess system interactions
# - Module-level state manipulation that interferes with pytest teardown
#
# These edge cases are covered by integration tests and manual testing,
# but cannot be reliably unit tested in this pytest environment due to
# irreconcilable conflicts with pytest's I/O capture infrastructure.
