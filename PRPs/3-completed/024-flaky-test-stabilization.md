# PRP-024: Flaky Test Stabilization - Complete Aiosqlite Removal

## Research Context & Architectural Analysis

### Research Integration
**Multi-Agent Analysis Complete**: Comprehensive 4-track investigation by specialist agents:
- **Database Connection Researcher**: Identified SQLAlchemy timeout race conditions and connection pool conflicts
- **Authentication Researcher**: Found environment variable propagation failures in pytest-xdist workers
- **Test Isolation Researcher**: Confirmed incomplete aiosqlite migration creating dual-backend resource conflicts
- **Performance Analyst**: Validated 75-85% teardown improvements achieved and preserved

**Root Cause Identified**: The test flakiness (60% failure rate across 5 consecutive runs) is caused by **incomplete aiosqlite removal** leaving active dual-backend systems that conflict during parallel pytest-xdist execution.

### Architectural Scope
**Current State**: "WiP - Remove aiosqlite backend completely" commit (2eec99a) left critical production aiosqlite code active
**Target State**: Complete SQLAlchemy-only architecture with 95%+ test reliability
**Performance Preservation**: Maintain all achieved teardown optimizations (9.57s → 2.47s improvements)

### Existing Patterns to Leverage
- **ContextVar-based managers**: Working correctly for database and auth isolation
- **SQLAlchemy connection wrappers**: Providing aiosqlite-compatible interface successfully
- **Test fixture patterns**: Database isolation working but needs dual-backend cleanup
- **Performance optimizations**: Timeout reductions and autocommit connections validated

## Implementation Specification

### Core Requirements

#### Phase 1: Critical - Complete Aiosqlite Removal (Target: 95%+ reliability)

**1.1 Remove Active Aiosqlite System**
- **File**: `src/shared_context_server/utils/performance.py` (629 lines)
- **Action**: Replace entire aiosqlite connection pool with SQLAlchemy equivalent OR deprecate with RuntimeError
- **Rationale**: This file contains fully functional aiosqlite connection pool competing with SQLAlchemy backend
- **Integration Impact**: Used by admin_lifecycle.py and background tasks - need replacement or graceful degradation

**1.2 Clean Migration Artifacts**
- **File**: `src/shared_context_server/test_database_context.py:30`
- **Change**: `backend="aiosqlite"` → `backend="sqlalchemy"`
- **File**: Database configuration references
- **Action**: Update all `sqlite+aiosqlite://` URLs to use SQLAlchemy-only paths
- **Impact**: Ensures single backend consistency across test infrastructure

**1.3 Database Connection Optimization**
- **File**: `src/shared_context_server/database_manager.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Increase engine disposal timeout: 5s → 15s for test environments
  - Add explicit SQLite pool disabling: `pool_size=0, poolclass=NullPool`
  - Implement exponential backoff retry for temp database creation
- **Rationale**: Prevents timeout race conditions under parallel pytest-xdist load

#### Phase 2: High Priority - Authentication Stability

**2.1 Environment Variable Propagation**
- **Scope**: pytest-xdist worker environment inheritance
- **Implementation**: Ensure `API_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `JWT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` propagate to all workers
- **Method**: pytest.ini configuration or fixture-based environment setup
- **Testing**: Verify auth tests pass consistently across all workers

**2.2 Mock Context Enhancement**
- **Files**: All test files using `MockContext` class
- **Enhancement**: Add proper `X-API-Key` headers to mock contexts
- **Validation**: Ensure `validate_api_key_header()` receives expected headers
- **Impact**: Fixes "assert False is True" authentication test failures

#### Phase 3: Medium Priority - Test Infrastructure Hardening

**3.1 Temp File Creation Safety**
- **File**: `tests/fixtures/database.py:49-52`
- **Enhancement**: Add file existence verification before SQLAlchemy initialization
- **Implementation**: Exponential backoff retry pattern for temp database creation
- **Validation**: Zero "unable to open database file" errors in parallel execution

### Integration Points

**Background Task Integration**:
- performance.py removal requires admin_lifecycle.py updates
- Background monitoring tasks need SQLAlchemy-compatible replacement
- Server lifecycle functions must use consistent database backend

**Test Infrastructure Integration**:
- Database fixtures must support SQLAlchemy-only initialization
- Mock contexts require headers compatible with authentication validation
- pytest-xdist workers need proper environment variable inheritance

**Performance Integration**:
- All optimizations must be preserved (timeout reductions, autocommit connections)
- SQLAlchemy disposal optimization must not break functionality
- Connection pooling configuration must support parallel test execution

### Data Model Changes
**No data model changes required** - this is infrastructure stabilization completing an incomplete migration.

### Interface Requirements
**No user-facing interface changes** - this is internal test infrastructure stabilization.

## Quality Requirements

### Testing Strategy
**Behavioral Testing Approach**:
1. **Reliability Validation**: Run full test suite 5 consecutive times, target 95%+ pass rate
2. **Performance Regression Testing**: Validate teardown times remain < 2s (preserve 75-85% improvements)
3. **Parallel Execution Testing**: Verify consistent results with pytest-xdist `-n auto`
4. **Authentication Flow Testing**: Validate auth tests pass consistently across all workers
5. **Database Connection Testing**: Zero "unable to open database file" errors

**Coverage Requirements**:
- All test categories: unit (750 tests), integration (58 tests), security tests
- All failure patterns: database connection, authentication, background tasks
- All parallel execution scenarios: multiple pytest-xdist worker configurations

### Documentation Needs
**Technical Documentation**:
- Update CLAUDE.md to reflect SQLAlchemy-only architecture decision
- Document environment variable requirements for pytest-xdist execution
- Record performance optimization settings and their rationale

**Implementation Documentation**:
- Document aiosqlite removal completion and timeline
- Record test stabilization approach and validation results
- Update troubleshooting guides for test execution

### Performance Considerations
**Performance Preservation Requirements**:
- **Critical**: Maintain 75-85% teardown time improvements (9.57s → 2.47s achieved)
- **Database Operations**: Keep <2s teardown times across all test categories
- **Parallel Execution**: Ensure optimal pytest-xdist worker utilization
- **Memory Usage**: SQLAlchemy configuration must not increase memory overhead significantly

**Performance Monitoring**:
- Validate slowest teardown times remain under performance targets
- Monitor SQLAlchemy connection pool efficiency vs previous aiosqlite performance
- Track test execution reliability metrics pre/post implementation

## Coordination Strategy

### Recommended Approach: Single Agent (cfw-developer)
**Rationale for cfw-developer**:
- **Research Complete**: Comprehensive 4-track analysis completed, root causes clearly identified
- **Focused Scope**: Specific file modifications with well-defined technical changes
- **Low Risk**: Completing incomplete migration, not creating new architecture
- **Sequential Implementation**: Phases can be implemented and validated incrementally
- **Performance Preservation**: Clear requirements to maintain existing optimizations

### Implementation Phases
**Phase 1 (Critical - 2-3 hours)**:
1. Analyze performance.py dependencies and create SQLAlchemy replacement
2. Update test_database_context.py and configuration references
3. Optimize SQLAlchemy timeouts and connection pooling for test environments
4. Validate database connection stability with parallel execution testing

**Phase 2 (High - 1 hour)**:
1. Fix authentication environment variable propagation for pytest-xdist
2. Enhance MockContext headers for auth validation compatibility
3. Validate auth tests pass consistently across worker processes

**Phase 3 (Medium - 1-2 hours)**:
1. Implement temp file creation safety with exponential backoff
2. Add SQLAlchemy connection pool optimization for parallel testing
3. Clean up remaining aiosqlite references across all files

**Validation Phase (1 hour)**:
1. Run 5 consecutive full test suite executions
2. Validate 95%+ pass rate and <2s teardown performance targets
3. Verify zero occurrence of known failure patterns

### Risk Mitigation
**Low Risk Profile**:
- **No Architecture Changes**: Completing existing migration, not creating new systems
- **Clear Rollback Path**: Git version control provides immediate rollback capability
- **Performance Validated**: Optimization improvements already proven and tested
- **Research Foundation**: Multi-agent analysis provides comprehensive technical foundation

**Risk Controls**:
- Incremental implementation with validation at each phase
- Performance regression testing at each step
- Full test suite validation before completion
- Session documentation of all changes for troubleshooting

### Dependencies
**Prerequisites**: None - research phase complete, codebase analysis finished
**Integration Requirements**: Must preserve performance optimizations and SQLAlchemy architecture
**Success Dependencies**: pytest-xdist configuration, environment variable propagation, SQLAlchemy timeouts

## Success Criteria
