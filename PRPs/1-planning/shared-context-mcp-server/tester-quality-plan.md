# Shared Context MCP Server - Comprehensive Testing Strategy

**Document Type**: Quality Assurance Strategy
**Target System**: Shared Context MCP Server MVP
**Testing Philosophy**: Behavioral Testing with Zero-Error Tolerance
**Created**: 2025-01-10

## Executive Summary

This document defines a comprehensive testing strategy for the Shared Context MCP Server that prioritizes **behavioral testing over implementation testing**. The strategy ensures reliability, security, and performance while supporting rapid MVP development iteration through modern testing patterns and 100x faster in-memory testing approaches.

**Key Principles:**
- **Test what the system does, not how it does it**
- **Zero-error tolerance**: All tests must pass, all warnings addressed immediately
- **FastMCP in-memory testing**: 100x faster than process-based testing
- **Multi-agent behavioral focus**: Real collaboration scenarios over mock-heavy approaches
- **Progressive quality gates**: Each phase has specific acceptance criteria

## 1. Behavioral Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Multi-Agent Collaboration Testing Patterns

Based on research of FastMCP best practices and the existing `.claude/tech-guides/testing.md` foundation, our testing approach focuses on realistic multi-agent scenarios:

#### Core Behavioral Scenarios

**Primary Agent Workflows**
```python
@pytest.mark.behavioral
async def test_claude_orchestrator_creates_shared_session():
    """
    Behavior: Claude (orchestrator) creates a session that other agents can join

    Scenario:
    1. Claude creates session with purpose "Feature Development"
    2. Developer and Tester agents join the session
    3. All agents can see session exists and access initial context
    4. Session metadata correctly shows Claude as creator

    Success Criteria:
    - Session created with unique ID
    - All agents can access session resource
    - Creator attribution is preserved
    - Agent permissions are correctly applied
    """
```

**Real-Time Context Sharing**
```python
@pytest.mark.behavioral
async def test_multi_agent_context_synchronization():
    """
    Behavior: When one agent adds context, others see it immediately

    Scenario:
    1. Developer adds implementation plan to shared session
    2. Tester subscribes to session updates
    3. Tester receives real-time notification of new message
    4. Tester can search and find the implementation context

    Success Criteria:
    - Real-time notifications delivered within 100ms
    - Context search returns accurate results
    - Message ordering preserved across agents
    - No message loss or duplication
    """
```

#### Agent Memory Privacy and Security Testing

**Private Memory Isolation**
```python
@pytest.mark.behavioral
async def test_agent_private_memory_isolation():
    """
    Behavior: Agent private memory is truly private and isolated

    Scenario:
    1. Developer stores private implementation notes
    2. Tester stores private test strategies
    3. Both agents work in same session
    4. Neither can access the other's private memory

    Security Verification:
    - Memory keys are agent-scoped
    - Cross-agent memory access fails gracefully
    - Private memory doesn't leak in session resources
    - Memory cleanup on agent disconnect
    """
```

#### Session Isolation and Visibility Testing

**Session Boundary Testing**
```python
@pytest.mark.behavioral
async def test_session_isolation_prevents_context_bleed():
    """
    Behavior: Sessions are completely isolated from each other

    Scenario:
    1. Claude creates Session A for "Auth Feature"
    2. Claude creates Session B for "Payment Feature"
    3. Developer adds messages to both sessions
    4. Context searches in Session A don't return Session B results

    Success Criteria:
    - Zero cross-session data leakage
    - Search results scoped to correct session
    - Agent subscriptions isolated per session
    - Resource URIs correctly namespaced
    """
```

### 1.2 Real-Time Subscription and Notification Testing

**Subscription Lifecycle Management**
```python
@pytest.mark.behavioral
async def test_subscription_lifecycle_robustness():
    """
    Behavior: Subscription system handles connection failures gracefully

    Scenarios:
    1. Agent subscribes to session, receives updates
    2. Agent connection drops, system cleans up subscription
    3. Agent reconnects, can re-subscribe to continue receiving updates
    4. System handles rapid subscribe/unsubscribe cycles

    Resilience Testing:
    - Network interruption simulation
    - High-frequency subscription changes
    - Memory leak prevention
    - Graceful degradation patterns
    """
```

## 2. Quality Gates and Success Criteria

    Load Pattern:
    - 20 agents connect simultaneously
    - Each agent: 10 message adds + 5 searches
    - All operations complete within performance targets
    - No memory leaks or connection issues
    """
```

## 3. Test Infrastructure Design

    """FastMCP in-memory client - 100x faster than process-based testing."""
    async with Client(mcp_server) as client:  # Direct server connection
        yield client
```

### 3.2 Pytest Configuration with Parallel Execution

**pytest.ini Configuration**
```ini
[tool:pytest]
asyncio_mode = auto
addopts =
    --cov=shared_context_server
    --cov-report=html
    --cov-report=term
    --cov-fail-under=85

```python
@pytest.fixture
def agent_identities():
    """Real agent identities matching production configuration."""
    return {
        "claude_main": {
            "agent_id": "claude-main-orchestrator",
            "agent_type": "orchestrator",
            "permissions": ["create", "read", "write", "delete", "admin"],
            "scopes": ["session:admin", "memory:read", "memory:write"]

### 3.4 Database and Test Data Management

**Factory Pattern for Consistent Test Data**
```python
# tests/factories.py
import factory
import json
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from shared_context_server.models import MessageModel, SessionModel

class SessionFactory(factory.Factory):
    class Meta:
        model = dict

    purpose = factory.Faker('sentence', nb_words=4)
    created_by = "test-agent"
    metadata = factory.LazyFunction(lambda: json.dumps({"type": "test_session"}))

class MessageFactory(factory.Factory):
    class Meta:
        model = dict

    sender = "test-agent"
    content = factory.Faker('text', max_nb_chars=200)
    visibility = "public"
    message_type = "agent_response"
    metadata = factory.LazyFunction(lambda: json.dumps({"type": "test_message"}))

# Async database cleanup between tests
@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
async def cleanup_database(test_database):
    """Ensure clean database state between tests."""
    yield  # Run the test

    # Cleanup after test
    async with aiosqlite.connect(test_database) as conn:
        await conn.execute("DELETE FROM agent_memory")
        await conn.execute("DELETE FROM messages")
        await conn.execute("DELETE FROM sessions")
        await conn.commit()
```

- ✅ Full CI/CD pipeline integration

## 8. Risk Mitigation and Contingency Plans

### 8.1 Common Testing Risks

**Risk: Test Suite Too Slow**
- *Mitigation*: FastMCP in-memory testing (100x speedup)
- *Fallback*: Parallel test execution with pytest-xdist
- *Monitor*: Test execution time tracking in CI

**Risk: Flaky Multi-Agent Tests**
- *Mitigation*: Deterministic test data and proper cleanup
- *Fallback*: Test retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- *Monitor*: Flakiness tracking and automatic quarantine

**Risk: Database Test Isolation Issues**
- *Mitigation*: Function-scoped database fixtures
- *Fallback*: Transaction rollback for each test
- *Monitor*: Database state validation between tests

### 8.2 Quality Assurance Escalation

**Escalation Triggers - STOP Development When:**
- Test coverage drops below 85%
- Any critical behavioral test fails
- Performance benchmarks regress by >20%
- Security tests reveal vulnerabilities
- Memory leaks detected in load testing

**Resolution Protocol:**
1. **Immediate**: Stop feature development, focus on test fix
2. **Analysis**: Root cause analysis with full team involvement
3. **Remediation**: Fix issue and strengthen testing to prevent recurrence
4. **Validation**: Full test suite must pass before resuming development

## 9. Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

### 9.1 Testing Documentation Standards

**Test Documentation Requirements:**
- Every behavioral test includes scenario description
- Performance tests document baseline and thresholds
- Security tests explain threat model and validation approach
- Integration tests describe system boundaries and assumptions

**Example Test Documentation:**
```python
@pytest.mark.behavioral
async def test_multi_agent_feature_development_workflow():
    """
    Complete Multi-Agent Feature Development Workflow Test

    BUSINESS SCENARIO:
    Claude orchestrates feature development with developer and tester agents
    collaborating on shared context throughout implementation lifecycle.

    AGENT ROLES:
    - Claude: Creates session, defines requirements, coordinates workflow
    - Developer: Implements features, updates progress, handles technical decisions
    - Tester: Validates implementation, runs tests, ensures quality

    SUCCESS CRITERIA:
    - All agents can access shared context throughout workflow
    - Private agent memory remains isolated and secure
    - Real-time updates keep agents synchronized
    - Final context contains complete audit trail

    PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
    - Workflow completes within 30 seconds
    - No message loss or ordering issues
    - Memory usage remains stable throughout
    """
```

### 9.2 Team Knowledge Sharing

**Testing Best Practices Workshops:**
- Monthly "Testing Patterns" sessions
- New team member testing orientation
- Advanced testing technique knowledge sharing
- Performance optimization workshops

**Continuous Improvement Process:**
- Weekly test suite performance review
- Monthly test coverage and quality analysis
- Quarterly testing strategy review and updates
- Annual testing technology and framework evaluation
