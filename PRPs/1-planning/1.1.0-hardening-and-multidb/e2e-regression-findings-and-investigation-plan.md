# E2E Regression Findings & Investigation Plan

**Date:** 2025-08-23
**Branch:** aiosqlite-removal
**Test Target:** scs-dev vs shared-context-server (main)
**Test Framework:** Manual E2E regression suite

## Executive Summary

Critical regressions detected in `scs-dev` branch during comprehensive E2E testing. Main branch (`shared-context-server`) passes all tests, while current branch shows complete memory system failure and search functionality degradation. **Deployment blocked pending investigation and fixes.**

## Test Results Overview

|---------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Authentication | ‚úÖ PASS | ‚úÖ PASS | OK |
| Session Management | ‚úÖ PASS | ‚úÖ PASS | OK |
| Message Operations | ‚úÖ PASS | ‚úÖ PASS | OK |

| Concurrent Operations | ‚úÖ PASS | ‚úÖ PASS | OK |
| **Performance/Scale** | ‚úÖ PASS | ‚ùå **SKIPPED** | üö® BLOCKED |

**Result:** 7/10 tests passed in scs-dev vs 10/10 in main branch

## Critical Findings

### 1. Database Unavailability (CRITICAL)

**Symptom:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "database temporarily unavailable during get_memory. This is likely temporary.",
  "code": "DATABASE_UNAVAILABLE",
  "severity": "error",
  "recoverable": true
}
```

**Impact:**
- Complete failure of memory retrieval operations
- Memory storage appears successful but retrieval consistently fails
- Blocks memory isolation testing and performance testing

**Affected Operations:**
- `get_memory` (session and global scope)
- Memory isolation validation
- Scale testing with memory components

### 2. Search Results Empty (DEGRADED)

**Symptom:**
- Search executes successfully with excellent performance (3.97ms)
- Returns empty results despite messages being successfully stored
- RapidFuzz optimization appears active

**Impact:**
- Search functionality non-functional despite technical success
- Possible data retrieval pipeline disconnection

### 3. Performance Characteristics

**shared-context-server (baseline):**
- Memory operations: 300-500ms (normal)
- Search operations: 200-220ms (normal)
- Total test runtime: ~3 minutes

**scs-dev (current):**
- Memory operations: Complete failure
- Search operations: 3.97ms (suspiciously fast, likely not accessing data)
- Total test runtime: ~2 minutes (due to skipped tests)

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Root Cause Analysis (Priority 1 - URGENT)

#### 1.1 Database Connection Investigation
- **Objective:** Determine why memory operations fail with DATABASE_UNAVAILABLE
- **Actions:**
  1. Examine database connection configuration in scs-dev
  2. Compare SQLAlchemy vs aiosqlite initialization patterns
  3. Check connection pooling and timeout settings
  4. Validate database file permissions and access patterns
  5. Test database connectivity manually outside MCP context

- **Files to Examine:**
  - `src/shared_context_server/database_manager.py` (modified)
  - Database connection initialization code
  - Environment variable handling for `USE_SQLALCHEMY`

#### 1.2 Memory Pipeline Analysis
- **Objective:** Understand disconnect between storage success and retrieval failure
- **Actions:**
  1. Trace memory storage flow vs retrieval flow
  2. Examine transaction handling differences
  3. Validate data persistence between operations
  4. Check for connection pooling issues

#### 1.3 Search Functionality Investigation
- **Objective:** Determine why search returns empty results despite fast execution
- **Actions:**
  1. Verify message storage is actually persisting to database
  2. Check search query construction and execution
  3. Examine message visibility filtering in search context
  4. Validate RapidFuzz integration with new database backend

### Phase 2: Targeted Testing (Priority 2 - HIGH)

#### 2.1 Backend Switching Validation
- **Actions:**
  1. Test `USE_SQLALCHEMY=true` vs `USE_SQLALCHEMY=false` explicitly
  2. Validate backend detection logic
  3. Run existing test suite: `tests/test_simplified_backend_switching.py`
  4. Check for environment variable propagation issues

#### 2.2 Database Initialization Testing
- **Actions:**
  1. Run database-specific tests:
     - `tests/unit/test_database_*` (if any remain)
     - `tests/behavioral/test_database_*` (if any remain)
  2. Test fresh database initialization
  3. Validate schema compatibility between backends

#### 2.3 Integration Testing
- **Actions:**
  1. Run focused integration tests on memory operations
  2. Test search functionality in isolation
  3. Validate concurrent access patterns

### Phase 3: Fix Implementation (Priority 3 - MEDIUM)

#### 3.1 Database Connection Fixes
- **Based on Phase 1 findings, likely fixes:**
  1. Database connection string/configuration
  2. Connection lifecycle management
  3. Transaction handling consistency
  4. Error handling improvements

#### 3.2 Search Pipeline Fixes
- **Based on Phase 1 findings, likely fixes:**
  1. Message retrieval query corrections
  2. Data persistence validation
  3. Search index/cache consistency

#### 3.3 Performance Optimization
- **Actions:**
  1. Restore normal operation timing
  2. Fix suspiciously fast search (likely bypassing data access)
  3. Validate memory operation performance

## Implementation Strategy

### Immediate Actions (Today)
1. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED:** Document findings and block deployment
2. **TODO:** Run existing automated test suite to validate findings:
   ```bash
   USE_SQLALCHEMY=true uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
   USE_SQLALCHEMY=false uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
   ```
3. **TODO:** Examine recent commits in `aiosqlite-removal` branch for database-related changes

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Execute Phase 1 investigation plan
2. Implement critical fixes for database unavailability
3. Restore search functionality
4. Re-run complete E2E regression suite

### Medium Term (Next Week)
1. Comprehensive backend switching validation
2. Performance optimization and validation
3. Additional edge case testing
4. Documentation updates

## Risk Assessment

### Deployment Risk: üî¥ **CRITICAL - DO NOT DEPLOY**
- Core functionality completely broken
- Memory system non-functional
- Search functionality degraded
- Potential data integrity issues

### Investigation Risk: üü° **MEDIUM**
- Database issues may require significant refactoring
- Backend switching logic may need redesign
- Timeline impact on project goals

### Rollback Risk: üü¢ **LOW**
- Main branch fully functional as fallback
- Clear test coverage validates main branch stability
- No production impact if staying on main

## Success Criteria for Fix Validation

### Minimum Acceptable (Ready for Re-test)
- [ ] Memory operations return success=true consistently
- [ ] Search returns non-empty results for valid queries
- [ ] Database connection remains stable across operations
- [ ] All automated tests pass

### Full Success (Ready for Deployment)
- [ ] Complete E2E regression suite passes (10/10 tests)
- [ ] Performance matches or exceeds main branch baseline
- [ ] No new error conditions introduced
- [ ] Backend switching works reliably in both modes

## Test Artifacts

### Successful Configurations
- **shared-context-server (main):** All tests pass, stable performance
- **Token formats:** `sct_` prefix working correctly
- **Error handling:** Consistent format and helpful messages
- **Concurrency:** Multiple agent support functional

### Failed Configurations
- **scs-dev memory operations:** DATABASE_UNAVAILABLE consistently
- **scs-dev search:** Empty results despite successful storage
- **Performance timing:** Abnormally fast search suggests data access bypass

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Start Phase 1 investigation focusing on database connection issues
2. **URGENT:** Identify root cause of DATABASE_UNAVAILABLE error
3. **PRIORITY:** Fix and validate memory operations before proceeding
4. **MILESTONE:** Re-run complete E2E suite to validate fixes

**Owner:** Development Team
**Review:** Before any deployment attempt
**Update Frequency:** Daily during investigation phase

*This document should be updated as investigation progresses and fixes are implemented. All changes should be tracked with timestamps and findings should be validated against the E2E test suite before marking as resolved.*
