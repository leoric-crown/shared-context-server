for session / chat view:

pin everything up to the messages + memory tabs (and filter controls if shown)

also add x minutes/hours/days ago to all timestamps (we are missing on messages now) as we did in session cards

we should also make sure all the info in cards from dashboard are visible in the sticky header session info (including the title)

in the session dashboard:
place a similar sitkcy header as weve done for the session chat view with basic stats of stale/recent/active sessions (follow similar sizes / compactness)
