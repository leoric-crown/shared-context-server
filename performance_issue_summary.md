# Performance Issue Summary

## Problem

During the E2E regression test, specifically in **Test 10: Performance and Scale Testing**, the server failed to handle a moderate load of concurrent requests. This resulted in multiple "DATABASE_UNAVAILABLE" errors.

## Root Cause Analysis

A review of the server logs (`logs/dev-server.log`) revealed that the underlying issue is a `sqlalchemy.exc.TimeoutError`. The specific error message is:

```
sqlalchemy.exc.TimeoutError: QueuePool limit of size 5 overflow 10 reached, connection timed out, timeout 30.00
```

This error indicates that the SQLAlchemy database connection pool was exhausted. The current configuration allows for a maximum of 15 simultaneous connections (a pool size of 5 with an overflow of 10). The performance test exceeded this limit, causing requests to time out.

## Solution

To address this issue, the size of the SQLAlchemy connection pool needs to be increased to accommodate a higher number of concurrent requests. This can be done by modifying the SQLAlchemy configuration in the project.

## Next Steps

The next step is to locate the SQLAlchemy configuration file and increase the `pool_size` and/or `max_overflow` parameters.

## Suggested Solution

The root cause of the performance issue is the default configuration of the SQLAlchemy connection pool for SQLite. The `pool_size` and `max_overflow` parameters are not explicitly set for SQLite, causing SQLAlchemy to use its default values (5 and 10 respectively), which are too low for the concurrent load of the performance test.

To fix this, I recommend modifying the `_get_engine_config` method in `src/shared_context_server/database_sqlalchemy.py` to include `pool_size` and `max_overflow` in the SQLite configuration.

### Code Modification

In `src/shared_context_server/database_sqlalchemy.py`, change the `_get_engine_config` method from:

```python
def _get_engine_config(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Return database-specific engine configuration."""
    if self.db_type == "sqlite":
        return {
            "pool_pre_ping": True,
            "pool_recycle": 3600,
            # Apply the same PRAGMA optimizations as aiosqlite implementation
            "connect_args": {
                "isolation_level": None,  # Enable autocommit mode for better performance
            },
        }
```

to:

```python
def _get_engine_config(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Return database-specific engine configuration."""
    if self.db_type == "sqlite":
        return {
            "pool_size": 20,
            "max_overflow": 30,
            "pool_pre_ping": True,
            "pool_recycle": 3600,
            # Apply the same PRAGMA optimizations as aiosqlite implementation
            "connect_args": {
                "isolation_level": None,  # Enable autocommit mode for better performance
            },
        }
```

This change will increase the connection pool size for SQLite to be in line with the PostgreSQL configuration, which should be sufficient to handle the load from the performance test.
