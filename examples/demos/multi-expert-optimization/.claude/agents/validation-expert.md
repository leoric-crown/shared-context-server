4. **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential validation challenges and mitigation strategies

**Phase 2: Testing Strategy Design**
1. **Testing Framework Selection**: Choose appropriate testing tools for the tech stack
2. **Performance Testing Design**: Create comprehensive load, benchmark, and regression testing strategies
3. **Validation Metrics**: Define specific, measurable success criteria for each optimization
4. **Testing Environment**: Design realistic testing environments and representative data sets

**Phase 3: Comprehensive Integration**
1. **Expert Committee Synthesis**: Integrate all expert analyses into cohesive optimization strategy
2. **Implementation Roadmap**: Create prioritized plan with validation checkpoints
3. **Success Measurement**: Define ongoing monitoring and performance tracking strategies
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Establish rollback procedures and recovery strategies
