## üéØ Quick Understanding (30 seconds)

**The Demo**: Watch three AI experts (Performance Architect ‚Üí Implementation Expert ‚Üí Validation Expert) collaborate autonomously to analyze any codebase more effectively than a single agent could.

**The Collaboration**: Each expert builds on the previous expert's findings through persistent shared sessions - no manual coordination required.

```
Agent 1: "Found 4 performance bottlenecks with evidence"
Agent 2: "Building on your analysis, here are concrete solutions"
Agent 3: "Designing tests for both your findings - comprehensive strategy complete"
```

üí° **Uses shared-context-server MCP tools**: Universal protocol that works with Claude Code, Gemini, VS Code, Cursor, and custom frameworks.

## üöÄ Quick Start (2-3 minutes)

### Step 1: Generate Keys & Start Server

**üöÄ One-Command Demo Setup (Recommended)**
```bash
# Clone and generate keys directly for demo
git clone https://github.com/leoric-crown/shared-context-server.git
cd shared-context-server
python scripts/generate_keys.py --demo --uvx
# ‚Ü≥ Generates secure keys, saves to demo directory, shows next steps
```

**Start the Server:**
```bash
# Follow the exact commands shown by the script above
cd examples/demos/multi-expert-optimization/

# For uvx (recommended):
API_KEY="your-generated-key" JWT_SECRET_KEY="your-generated-secret" \
JWT_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-generated-encryption-key" \
uvx shared-context-server --transport http

# For Docker:
docker compose up -d
```

### Step 2: Connect Claude Code

```bash
# Use the API key from Step 1 key generation
# For uvx (port 23456):
claude mcp add --transport http scs http://localhost:23456/mcp/ \
  --header "X-API-Key: YOUR_GENERATED_API_KEY"

# For Docker demo (port 23432):
claude mcp add --transport http scs http://localhost:23432/mcp/ \
  --header "X-API-Key: YOUR_GENERATED_API_KEY"

# Alternative: Copy examples/demos/multi-expert-optimization/demo.mcp.json
# to your Claude Code settings and update the API key
```

### Step 3: Verify Setup
```bash
# Health check
# For uvx:
curl http://localhost:23456/health
# For Docker demo:
curl http://localhost:23432/health

# View dashboard (optional)
# For uvx:
open http://localhost:23456/ui/
# For Docker demo:
open http://localhost:23432/ui/
```

**‚úÖ Success**: Health endpoint returns healthy status and Claude Code shows `‚úì Connected`

## ‚ú® What You'll Experience

### The Expert Committee
- **Performance Architect**: Identifies bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **Implementation Expert**: Transforms strategies into concrete code solutions
- **Validation Expert**: Designs testing frameworks and success metrics

### Autonomous Coordination
- Experts share findings through persistent sessions
- Each expert builds on the previous expert's analysis
- Visible handoffs show coordination in action
- Memory persistence enables expertise building over time

## üéØ Demo Script (5-7 minutes)

### The Magic Prompt
Copy this exact prompt to Claude Code:
```
I want to optimize this repository using our expert committee approach. Please start by having our Performance Architect analyze the codebase for bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
```

### What Happens Next (Autonomous Coordination)
**Phase 1**: **Performance Architect** (2-3 minutes)
- Repository analysis using octocode MCP integration
- Identifies specific bottlenecks with evidence
- Stores findings in shared session
- **Handoff**: "Implementation Expert: Based on my analysis..."

**Phase 2**: **Implementation Expert** (2-3 minutes)
- Reads Performance Architect's findings from session
- Develops concrete code solutions
- Provides implementation details and risk assessment
- **Handoff**: "Validation Expert: I've developed solutions..."

**Phase 3**: **Validation Expert** (1-2 minutes)
- Integrates both previous expert analyses
- Designs comprehensive testing strategy
- **Summary**: "Expert Committee Summary: Complete optimization strategy..."

### Value Demonstration
Ask Claude:
```
Show me how the experts coordinated and built on each other's findings. What would this analysis have looked like with a single agent instead?
```

**Expected Result**: Clear demonstration of knowledge building through expert coordination vs. surface-level single-agent advice.

## üìã Expected Outcomes

### Performance Analysis
- **Specific Bottlenecks**: Concrete performance issues with evidence from code analysis
- **Impact Assessment**: Quantified performance impact of each identified issue
- **Optimization Strategy**: Prioritized roadmap based on impact and feasibility

### Implementation Strategy

- **Technical Approach**: Framework-specific optimizations and best practices
- **Risk Assessment**: Implementation complexity and potential side effects

### Validation Framework
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive validation approaches for proposed optimizations
- **Success Metrics**: Clear, measurable criteria for optimization success
- **Monitoring Plan**: Ongoing performance tracking and regression detection

## üîß Technical Details

### MCP Integration
- **shared-context-server**: Session management and expert coordination

### Expert Coordination Flow
```
Performance Architect ‚Üí Implementation Expert ‚Üí Validation Expert
       ‚Üì                        ‚Üì                      ‚Üì
   Shared Session          Shared Session        Final Summary
   (Analysis Results)      (Solutions)           (Complete Strategy)
```

### Memory Architecture
- **Session Memory**: Immediate coordination and handoff context
- **Persistent Memory**: Expert knowledge building across multiple analyses
- **Visibility Controls**: Public coordination visible to all experts

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Benefits

## üö® Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>üîß Common Setup Issues</summary>

### Key Generation Problems
```bash
# If generate_keys.py fails
pip install cryptography

# Verify Python version
python --version  # Requires Python 3.10+
```

### Server Connection Issues
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:23456/health
# Expected: {"status": "healthy", ...}

# For uvx (recommended) - server logs appear in terminal where you ran uvx

# For Docker - check logs (from demo directory)
docker compose logs scs-demo
```

### MCP Connection Problems
```bash
# Test MCP tools discovery
claude mcp list
# Expected: ‚úì Connected status for shared-context-server

# Verify API key
echo $API_KEY  # Should show your generated key

# Alternative: Check Claude Code settings for proper API key
```

</details>

<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è Demo Execution Issues</summary>

### Expert Coordination Not Visible
- **Check**: Ask Claude to "show me the current session messages"
- **Verify**: Experts should reference previous findings in their responses
- **Recovery**: "Please have the experts coordinate through our shared session"

### GitHub Authentication (Optional)
```bash
# For external repository analysis
gh auth login

# Fallback: Use shared-context-server self-analysis
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# For uvx deployment (recommended)
# Stop with Ctrl+C and restart with the uvx command

# For Docker deployment (from demo directory)
docker compose restart scs-demo
```
